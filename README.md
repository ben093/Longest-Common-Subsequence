# Longest-Common-Subsequence
A C++ dynamic programming implementation of longest common sub-sequence. CSC 325 - Algorithms

Problem:  
  Write a C++ program to calculate the longest common subsequence of two DNA sequences through dynamic programming. You might search online what DNA sequences look like, which are sequences of four bases (ATCG). 
 
Input:  
  User can type two random DNA sequences with any length at keyboard. Your program should allow the user to continue trying to input new pair of sequences for calculation of LCS when the previous result is already displayed on the screen. The program will stop when the user chooses not to do this again.
 
Output:  
  the length of LCS and one example subsequence of LCS.
